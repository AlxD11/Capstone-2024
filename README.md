# Project description 
We chose to create a web tool where users can journal their thoughts and emotions, record their physical and mental state for the day, and review trends in this data to see patterns.  
We hope that being able to view this information over time will help users identify areas to improve their well-being. Additionally, we believe that the act of mood journaling and regular well-being check-ins will encourage users to become more mindful.
